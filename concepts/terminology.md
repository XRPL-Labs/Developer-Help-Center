# Terminology

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="225" align="right"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="right"><strong>Xaman</strong></td><td>The self custodial wallet application for iOS and Android developed by XRPL Labs. The app can be used by end users to manage their XRP Ledger account(s) and interact with the "Xaman Platform" (see below) through "Sign Requests" (see below).</td></tr><tr><td align="right"><strong>Xumm</strong></td><td>The previous name of Xaman, Xaman is formerly known as Xumm (and has rebranded). Some references in these docs may still point to our old name.</td></tr><tr><td align="right"><strong>Xumm Platform</strong></td><td>The platform your application and the Xaman app (iOS/Android) interact with. For developers, the platform offers the ability to send "Sign Requests" (see below) to the platform's "API" (see below). The Sign Request can then be interacted with by Xaman app users.</td></tr><tr><td align="right"><strong>Xaman API</strong></td><td>The endpoints providing features to developers &#x26; integrated applications. The API endpoint reference can be found here: <a href="https://xumm.readme.io/reference">https://xumm.readme.io/reference</a> but a more convenient way to interact with the Xaman Platform is through our SDK's (packages): <a href="https://docs.xumm.dev/#packages">https://docs.xumm.dev/#packages</a></td></tr><tr><td align="right"><strong>Developer Console</strong></td><td>The Developer Console is where you can get your credentials (API Key &#x26; secret) and configure your Xaman platform integration. You can find the Xaman Developer Console at <a href="https://apps.xumm.dev/">https://apps.xumm.dev</a></td></tr><tr><td align="right"><strong>Documentation</strong></td><td>This website: <a href="https://docs.xumm.dev/">https://docs.xumm.dev</a></td></tr><tr><td align="right"><strong>API Documentation</strong></td><td>API endpoint reference: <a href="https://xumm.readme.io/reference">https://xumm.readme.io/reference</a></td></tr><tr><td align="right"><strong>Sign Request</strong></td><td>When you send a call to the Xumm Platform to ask a user to sign a transaction, you are creating a "Sign Request". You are delivering a "Payload" (see below) to the Xumm platform, containing the transaction template you would like the user to sign &#x26; possibly some options. You obtain a unique UUID (identifier) to the Sign Request to get real time status updates, Webhooks upon status change &#x26; when signed: the on ledger Transaction Hash and signed transaction.</td></tr><tr><td align="right"><strong>Payload</strong></td><td>The Payload (JSON formatted) is part of a Sign Request. It contains the Transaction Template to offer to the end user to sign. The Payload matches the formatting, fields &#x26; properties of native XRP Ledger transactions, except for the fact that some fields (like Fee, Account, Sequence) can be omitted as Xamanm can add these for you.</td></tr><tr><td align="right"><strong>xApp</strong></td><td>An xApp is a Web App (HTML, JS, CSS) that can be opened inside Xaman by users, straight from and in Xaman. See <a data-mention href="../environments/xapps-dapps/">xapps-dapps</a></td></tr><tr><td align="right"><strong>Frontend</strong></td><td>When referred to Frontend, we refer to <strong>your</strong> frontend: the HTML/JS/CSS application you are building, where you are integrating Xamanmm as <a data-mention href="../environments/xapps-dapps/">xapps-dapps</a>or <a data-mention href="../environments/browser-web3/">browser-web3</a> application.</td></tr><tr><td align="right"><strong>Backend</strong></td><td>Whe referred to Backend, we refer to <strong>your</strong> backend application. If you are building an xApp or Web3 (Browser) app, you may not have and may not need your own backend. If you are building a backend integration (e.g. headless application, backend for your own Frontend application), please see <a data-mention href="../environments/backend-sdk-api.md">backend-sdk-api.md</a></td></tr><tr><td align="right"><strong>SDK</strong></td><td>The most convenient way to interact with the Xaman Platform is through our SDK's (packages): <a href="https://docs.xumm.dev/#packages">https://docs.xumm.dev/#packages</a></td></tr><tr><td align="right"><strong>JWT</strong></td><td>JSON Web Token: the authorization bearer as provided by Xaman when using the <a data-mention href="../environments/xapps-dapps/">xapps-dapps</a> or <a data-mention href="../environments/browser-web3/">browser-web3</a> flow. Valid for 24h, bound to the Xum App user, you can call the Xaman platform to create Sign Requests &#x26; more.</td></tr><tr><td align="right"><strong>OTT</strong></td><td>"One Time Token", specific to xApps.
